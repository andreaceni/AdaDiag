The actual implementation of the model can be found in the folder ```src/rnn-of-rnns/torchdyno/models/rnn_assembly```.

Validation has been done via ```src/rnn-of-rnns/main_search.py``` file using the grid search specified in the ```src/rnn-of-rnns/search_space.py``` file.

Final results have been obtained via ```src/rnn-of-rnns/final_train_and_test.py``` file.
